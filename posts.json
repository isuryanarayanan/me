In our contemporary context, however, surveillance extends beyond mere discipline—it's a relentless process of data extraction. Human presence is converted from flesh and blood into pixels and data. In this video, sound generated using puredata is layered over an image created with midjourney, evoking a sense of networks and ceaseless data transmission, immersing the viewer in a digital flow of observation and control."

The fundamental intention of this experiment is to explore how language, pixels, vectors are all interconnected in a world of pseudo-futurism which might transformed to a \"future\".
