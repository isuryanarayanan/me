# Markdown Support Enhancement Plan

Currently in the `markdown-cell.tsx` the cells are rendering markdown but there is no proper formatting. This document outlines the current state and implementation plan divided into executable sections.

## Current Implementation

The markdown functionality is implemented across several files:

### Core Components

1. `markdown-cell.tsx`:

   - Uses `react-markdown` for rendering
   - Basic styling with Tailwind classes:
     ```tsx
     className =
       "prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none prose-headings:scroll-m-20 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-p:leading-7 prose-pre:rounded-md prose-pre:bg-muted prose-pre:p-4";
     ```
   - No additional markdown configurations or plugins

2. `cell-list.tsx`:
   - Provides editing interface for markdown content
   - Has preview functionality
   - Uses simple textarea for editing
   - Local storage for content persistence
   - Basic preview toggle functionality

### Editor Features

1. Editing:

   - Basic textarea input
   - Font-mono styling for better code editing
   - Auto-save to localStorage
   - Preview toggle button
   - No syntax highlighting
   - No markdown toolbar/shortcuts

2. Preview:
   - Live preview in a separate section
   - Basic prose styling for dark/light themes
   - No synchronized scrolling
   - Basic element styling (headings, paragraphs, pre blocks)

### Areas for Improvement

1. Editor Experience:

   - No markdown syntax highlighting
   - No toolbar for common markdown operations
   - No keyboard shortcuts
   - No paste handling for images/files
   - Basic textarea without line numbers

2. Preview:

   - Limited styling options
   - No support for advanced markdown features
   - No synchronized scrolling between edit/preview
   - No customization options for rendering

3. Functionality:

   - No table support
   - No code block syntax highlighting
   - No custom components in markdown
   - No image upload integration
   - No emoji support

4. User Interface:
   - Basic preview toggle
   - No split view option
   - No fullscreen mode
   - No custom themes for editor/preview

Next steps will involve implementing these improvements, prioritizing features based on user needs and impact.
